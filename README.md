 Hey there, I'm SabTech - a student in the aviation field and a passionate technology enthusiast. I'm currently working as an apprentice under the guidance of my friend Techno. Together, we're always looking for exciting new projects to explore and challenge our skills. Right now, we're diving into the world of gaming by reverse engineering and exploiting the popular game Splinter Cells from Tom Clancy. Although I don't have any previous experience with the game, I'm excited to learn and discover what secrets and surprises it holds. With Techno's guidance and my eagerness to learn, I'm confident that we'll make groundbreaking discoveries along the way.![Wallpaper sabtech](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132004384/235036823-deae3ef0-08b0-4c2b-855b-0bcde6e9b52a.png)
